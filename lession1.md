# The Boltzmann Distribution and Microstates of a Reservoir

## Fundamental Assumption of Statistical Mechanics  

The **fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics** states:  

> *In an isolated system at equilibrium, all accessible microstates are equally probable.*

This means that the probability of a system being in a particular state is proportional to the **number of microstates available to the surrounding reservoir**.

---

## Example: Two-State System in Contact with a Large Reservoir

### System & Reservoir Setup

Consider a **small system** ($S$) in thermal contact with a **large heat reservoir** ($R$). The **total energy** is fixed:

$$
E_{\text{total}} = E_S + E_R
$$

The system ($S$) can exist in **two states**:
- **State 1**: $E_S = 0$
- **State 2**: $E_S = \Delta E$

Since the **total energy is constant**, if the system is in state 2 with energy $\Delta E$, the reservoir must have energy:

$$
E_R = E_{\text{total}} - \Delta E
$$

whereas in state 1:

$$
E_R = E_{\text{total}}
$$

### Microstates & Probability Connection  

Let $\Omega_R(E)$ be the **number of microstates** available to the reservoir at energy $E$. The **probability** of the system being in a particular state is proportional to $\Omega_R(E_R)$:

$$
P_1 \propto \Omega_R(E_{\text{total}})
$$

$$
P_2 \propto \Omega_R(E_{\text{total}} - \Delta E)
$$

Since entropy is related to the number of microstates via:

$$
S_R = k_B \ln \Omega_R
$$

we rewrite the probabilities as:

$$
P_1 \propto e^{S_R(E_{\text{total}}) / k_B}
$$

$$
P_2 \propto e^{S_R(E_{\text{total}} - \Delta E) / k_B}
$$

Using the **Taylor expansion**:

$$
S_R(E_{\text{total}} - \Delta E) \approx S_R(E_{\text{total}}) - \frac{\Delta E}{T}
$$

we get:

$$
P_2 \propto e^{(S_R(E_{\text{total}}) - \Delta E / T) / k_B}
$$

$$
P_2 \propto e^{S_R(E_{\text{total}}) / k_B} e^{-\Delta E / k_B T}
$$

Since $e^{S_R(E_{\text{total}}) / k_B}$ is a constant that normalizes probabilities, we obtain:

$$
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = e^{-\Delta E / k_B T}
$$

This is the **Boltzmann factor**, showing that **higher-energy states are exponentially less probable than lower-energy states**.

---

## Physical Interpretation
- The probability of a system being in a particular energy state depends on the **number of microstates available to the reservoir**.
- A **lower system energy** means the **reservoir has more available microstates**, making that state **more probable**.
- A **higher system energy** means the **reservoir has fewer available microstates**, making that state **less probable**.
- The reservoir acts as a **thermostat**, ensuring energy is distributed according to the **Boltzmann distribution**.

---

## Key Takeaways
✅ **Probability is proportional to the number of reservoir microstates**.  
✅ **Lower-energy states are more probable because they leave more microstates for the reservoir**.  
✅ **This assumption leads directly to the Boltzmann distribution**.

# The Boltzmann Distribution in a Larger System

## Extending the Fundamental Assumption of Statistical Mechanics

The **fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics** states:

> *In an isolated system at equilibrium, all accessible microstates are equally probable.*

For a small system in contact with a reservoir, we showed that the **Boltzmann factor** arises naturally. Now, let’s extend this to a **larger system with multiple energy levels**.

---

## Example: Multi-Level System in Contact with a Large Reservoir

### System & Reservoir Setup

Consider a system $S$ in thermal equilibrium with a large heat reservoir $R$. The system can now occupy multiple discrete energy states:

$$
E_S = \{ E_1, E_2, E_3, ..., E_n \}
$$

The **total energy** is conserved:

$$
E_{\text{total}} = E_S + E_R
$$

Since the system exchanges energy with the reservoir, the probability of being in a specific energy state depends on the number of available microstates in the reservoir.

### Microstates & Probability Connection

As before, the probability of the system being in a particular energy state is proportional to the number of microstates available to the reservoir:

$$
P(E_i) \propto \Omega_R(E_{\text{total}} - E_i)
$$

Using entropy $S_R = k_B \ln \Omega_R$ and expanding via a **Taylor series**:

$$
S_R(E_{\text{total}} - E_i) \approx S_R(E_{\text{total}}) - \frac{E_i}{T}
$$

we obtain:

$$
P(E_i) \propto e^{-E_i / k_B T}
$$

which generalizes the **Boltzmann factor** to multiple states:

$$
P(E_i) = \frac{e^{-E_i / k_B T}}{Z}
$$

where **Z is the partition function**, defined as:

$$
Z = \sum_{i} e^{-E_i / k_B T}
$$

This normalization ensures that probabilities sum to 1.

---

## Physical Interpretation

- The **partition function** acts as a normalization factor that sums over all possible states.
- **Lower-energy states are exponentially more probable** than higher-energy states at a given temperature.
- The probability distribution follows the **Boltzmann distribution**:

  $$P(E_i) = \frac{e^{-E_i / k_B T}}{Z}$$

- In the **limit of a large system**, this approach forms the foundation for **statistical mechanics and thermodynamics**.

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **The partition function encodes all equilibrium properties of a system**.  
✅ **The probability of a state depends on its energy and temperature**.  
✅ **This principle extends to large systems, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations**.

# Many-Particle, Many-State System in Contact with a Heat Reservoir

Now, let’s generalize our understanding to a system containing **many particles**, where each particle can occupy **multiple energy states**. This scenario is relevant in both quantum and classical systems, such as **electrons in atoms** or **molecular energy levels**.

---

## System Setup: N Particles with Multiple Energy States
We consider a system of \( N \) **independent particles** in **thermal equilibrium** with a large heat reservoir at temperature \( T \). Each particle can occupy one of several discrete energy levels:

$$
E_0, E_1, E_2, ..., E_i, ...
$$

The system is in thermal contact with a **large heat reservoir**, which ensures energy exchange while maintaining a constant temperature. The **total energy** of the combined system (system + reservoir) remains fixed:

$$
E_{\text{total}} = E_S + E_R
$$

where \( E_S \) is the system’s energy, and \( E_R \) is the reservoir’s energy.

---

## Step 1: Probability of a System Configuration Based on Reservoir Microstates
The system’s probability of being in a particular configuration depends on the **number of microstates of the reservoir** at energy \( E_R \). According to the **fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics**, the probability of the system being in a state with energy \( E_S \) is proportional to the number of ways the reservoir can arrange itself at \( E_R \):

$$
P(E_S) \propto \Omega_R(E_R)
$$

where \( \Omega_R(E_R) \) represents the reservoir’s microstates at energy \( E_R \). Since the entropy of the reservoir is defined as:

$$
S_R = k_B \ln \Omega_R
$$

we express the probability as:

$$
P(E_S) \propto e^{S_R(E_R) / k_B}
$$

Using a **Taylor series expansion** around \( E_{\text{total}} \):

$$
S_R(E_R) = S_R(E_{\text{total}} - E_S) \approx S_R(E_{\text{total}}) - \frac{E_S}{T}
$$

we substitute into the probability expression:

$$
P(E_S) \propto e^{(S_R(E_{\text{total}}) - E_S / T) / k_B}
$$

$$
P(E_S) \propto e^{S_R(E_{\text{total}}) / k_B} e^{-E_S / k_B T}
$$

Since \( e^{S_R(E_{\text{total}}) / k_B} \) is a normalization constant, we obtain the **Boltzmann distribution**:

$$
P(E_S) = \frac{e^{-E_S / k_B T}}{Z}
$$

where \( Z \), the **partition function**, ensures proper normalization:

$$
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-E / k_B T}
$$

This result shows that **higher-energy configurations are exponentially less probable**.

---

## Step 2: Distributing Particles Among Energy States
Each of the \( N \) particles is independent and can occupy different energy levels. We define:
- \( n_i \) as the number of particles in state \( i \) with energy \( E_i \).
- The total number of particles:

  $$
  \sum_i n_i = N
  $$

- The system’s total energy:

  $$
  E_S = \sum_i n_i E_i
  $$

The number of ways to distribute \( N \) particles among available states follows the **multiplicity formula**:

$$
\Omega(N) = \frac{N!}{\prod_i n_i!}
$$

Since each configuration has probability \( P(E_S) \), the probability of a particular distribution \( \{n_i\} \) is:

$$
P(\{n_i\}) \propto e^{-\sum_i n_i E_i / k_B T} \cdot \frac{N!}{\prod_i n_i!}
$$

Applying **Stirling’s approximation** (\( \ln N! \approx N \ln N - N \)), we derive the **most probable particle distribution**, leading to the well-known **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution**:

$$
n_i = N \frac{e^{-E_i / k_B T}}{Z}
$$

This result states that the **fraction of particles in state \( E_i \) follows the Boltzmann factor**.

---

## Step 3: Physical Interpretation
1. **More particles occupy lower energy states** because this leaves more microstates available to the reservoir.
2. **Higher-energy states are exponentially suppressed** due to fewer accessible microstates.
3. **The probability of a state depends on both its energy and temperature**:
   - At **low temperatures**, most particles remain in the lowest energy states.
   - At **high temperatures**, particles spread across multiple energy levels.

---

## Key Takeaways
✅ **Probability of a system state is related to the number of reservoir microstates**.  
✅ **Higher-energy configurations are exponentially less probable**.  
✅ **The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution emerges from this framework**.

# Metropolis Algorithm in Monte Carlo Simulations

## Introduction
The **Metropolis algorithm** is a fundamental method in **Monte Carlo simulations** used to sample states from a probability distribution, particularly in the **canonical (NVT) ensemble**. It ensures that states are sampled according to the **Boltzmann distribution**, making it useful for studying **equilibrium properties** in statistical mechanics.

---

## Metropolis Algorithm Steps
Given a system with an **energy function** \( E(x) \), where \( x \) represents the system's configuration:

1. **Start with an initial configuration** \( x \).
2. **Generate a trial move** \( x' \) by randomly perturbing the system (e.g., moving a particle).
3. **Calculate the energy difference**:
   \[
   \Delta E = E(x') - E(x)
   \]
4. **Apply the Metropolis acceptance criterion**:
   - If \( \Delta E \leq 0 \) (i.e., the new state has lower energy), accept the move: \( x \to x' \).
   - If \( \Delta E > 0 \) (i.e., the new state has higher energy), accept with probability:
     \[
     P_{\text{accept}} = e^{-\Delta E / k_B T}
     \]
   - Generate a random number \( r \in [0,1] \). If \( r < P_{\text{accept}} \), accept \( x' \); otherwise, reject it and keep \( x \).
5. **Repeat the process** for many iterations to explore the configuration space.

---

## Why It Works
- Ensures **detailed balance**: The probability of moving from state \( x \) to \( x' \) is equal to the reverse transition probability in equilibrium.
- Guarantees **ergodicity**: The system explores all accessible configurations over time.
- Converges to the **Boltzmann distribution**, meaning more probable configurations appear more often.

---

## Metropolis Algorithm in the NVT Ensemble
In the **canonical ensemble**, the system:
- Has **fixed number of particles** (\(N\)).
- Is contained in a **fixed volume** (\(V\)).
- Maintains a **constant temperature** (\(T\)) via a heat reservoir.

The **Metropolis algorithm** samples configurations from the **canonical partition function**:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-E / k_B T}
\]

By performing **trial moves** and applying the Metropolis acceptance criterion, the simulation generates equilibrium configurations **weighted by the Boltzmann factor**.

---

## Applications in Molecular Simulations
- **Lennard-Jones fluids**: Study phase transitions of simple molecular systems.
- **Protein folding**: Simulate the energetics of biomolecules.
- **Material simulations**: Investigate solid-state properties and phase behavior.

---

## Key Takeaways
✅ The **Metropolis algorithm** efficiently samples states according to the **Boltzmann distribution**.
✅ It ensures **detailed balance** and **ergodicity** in Monte Carlo simulations.
✅ Used extensively in **molecular simulations** and **statistical mechanics**.
